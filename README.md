# Google_play_App_Install_Regression

## Task Objective
- **Generate a prediction model, where target variable is "Installs".**
- Model should be as simple as possible, but not simpler. 
- Given data is not clean. pre-processing (i.e. remove duplicates) might be required.
- Split the data file into 8:2 Train:Validation.
- Score (error metric) is: avg (abs(Log10(Actual) - Log10(Predicted)) )
- If the task description is unclear, you may make your own reasonable assumption. 
## To Do
- Provide the score for the validation set, and explain how you got it.
- 24hr is the official time limit. 8hr should be enough. for any unforeseen incident, you may request for deadline extension.
